# Market basket analysis demo
A market basket analysis demo based on the Open-CDP project [hosted here](https://share.streamlit.io/hassanj47/market_basket_analysis/app.py). The demo is built using streamlit, an awesome framework to build beautiful data apps. This demo includes common association rule algorithms (Apriori and FPGrowth for now) to do the analysis. Extensive options to prune the output are given alongside some visualizations.
